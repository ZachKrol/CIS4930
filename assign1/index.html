        <h1>How to Fold an Origami Balloon</h1>
        <h2 style="text-align: center">
          A beginner's guide to folding an origami balloon <br />that you can
          blow up and deflate yourself
        </h2>
        <hr />
        <p>After following this guide, you will have learned:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>How to properly select a paper material for making origami</li>
          <li>
            The sequence of moves, folds, and tucks to construct a paper balloon
          </li>
          <li>Proper hand and mouth placement for optimal inflation</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Being able to turn a flat piece of paper into a 3D shape is an amazing
          skill to have. It is also rewarding seeing your precision and patience
          pay off in the unique hobby of making origami. I've been folding
          origami ever since I was a child to pass the time in school, church,
          or elsewhere. One of my favorite designs to make is a paper balloon
          that can actually be inflated and retain the air inside of it. Today,
          I'm going to teach you how to make it step-by-step!
        </p>
        <p>What you will need:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A square piece of paper</li>
          <li>Less than 10 minutes</li>
          <li>Patience and precision</li>
        </ul>

        />
        <p class="step">Step 1</p>
        <p>
          Start with a square piece of paper. Origami paper works perfectly, but
          if you don't have any origami paper you can start with a rectangular
          piece of loose leaf paper or printer paper. If you do this, you will
          need to cut or rip it into a square shape. It is important not to
          choose a material too soft like tissue paper because you need the
          final design to hold its shape. Also, a material too hard such as
          cardboard will make folding and creasing the paper nearly impossible.
        </p>
        <p class="step">Step 2</p>
        <p>
          Make folds in the paper so that there is an 'x' connecting the corners
          and also a '+' connecting the 4 edges.
        </p>
        <p class="step">Step 3</p>
        <p>
          This is one of the hardest folds of the entire process. Take opposing
          edges, grab the centers of the edges and slowly bring them underneath
          the center vertex. The center vertex should start to push up as you
          bring the edges underneath. At the same time re-crease the diagonals
          to form a tent shape with the paper so that it can stand up on your
          table.
        </p>
        <p class="step">Step 4</p>
        <p>
          Take the propped up tent and lay it flat on one of it sides so it
          looks like a triangle facing you. (There should be 4 individual flaps)
        </p>
        <p class="step">Step 5</p>
        <p>
          Fold one of the flap corners up and connect the endpoint to top of the
          triangle.
        </p>
        <p class="step">Step 6</p>
        <p>
          Repeat step 5 for all of the flaps. You will do two on one side then
          flip the paper over and do two on the other side.
        </p>
        <p class="step">Step 7</p>
        <p>
          It should look like a diamond with an opening on the bottom tip. Take
          the left and right sides of the diamond and fold them to the
          center-line.
        </p>
        <p class="step">Step 8</p>
        <p>
          Repeat step 7 for all 4 flaps. The top side of the diamond (without
          the opening) should now have 4 newly loose flap pedals.
        </p>
        <p class="step">Step 9</p>
        <p>
          Take the loose flap from the top and fold it into the crevice that
          corresponds to it. Repeat for all new pedals.
        </p>
        <p class="step">Step 10</p>
        <p>
          Find the bottom of the diamond with the opening and pull on the edges
          a little to make the opening slightly bigger. Pinch the edges nearest
          to the hole, put your lips on the opening, and BLOW!
        </p>
        <p class="step">Step 11</p>
        <p>
          Watch as the paper balloon inflates and enjoy your new piece of art.
        </p>
