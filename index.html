          <a class="assignment" href="./assign1">Assignment 1</a>
          <p>
            The first assignment consisted of making multiple static web pages
            using HTML and CSS basics. The web pages included an ePortfolio page
            for the course CIS4930, a lesson-based teaching page, and an
            assessment page. Each page has unique sections the user can interact
            with to navigate back and forth throughout the website.
          </p>
          <p>
            I learned common HTML tags such as headings and paragraphs to format
            text, tables and lists to structure information, and anchor and
            images to guide the user toward different things. I also
            incorporated CSS styles and stylesheet linking to be organized and
            consistent with styling throughout the website. I thought these
            principles were foundational in learning other tools later on in
            this course and in the industry. I also learned it can be very time
            consuming figuring out how to center a simple table in the middle of
            the page...
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Implement HTML and CSS basics</li>
            <li>SSH to a Linux machine and navigate the folder structure</li>
            <li>Use relative and absolute paths</li>
          </ul>

          <a class="assignment" href="./assign2">Assignment 2</a>
          <p>
            The second assignment involves creating a web page to demonstrate a
            calculation using user data. The data is collected with form fields
            that each serve different purposes such as radio buttons, dropdowns,
            text boxes, and checkboxes. Also, verification and error-checking
            are performed to ensure the data will be processed correctly. After
            the user clicks the submit button, the results of the calculation
            are displayed on the screen.
          </p>
          <p>
            I learned a few more HTML tags and also how one CSS stylesheet can
            be applied to many pages. The biggest challenge for me was deciding
            on what to calculate without being too complex or simple. I drew
            inspiration from a BMI calculator and added my own twist of boxing
            to the web page. I learned the importance of identifying HTML
            elements to use them at a later time. It is better to do something
            correctly the first time then to have to go back and redo it.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Learn new HTML tags to control input fields</li>
            <li>Retrieve and use information from the DOM</li>
            <li>Manipulate data with JavaScript and display it</li>
            <li>Develop basic flowchart</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <hr />
        <section>
          <a class="assignment" href="./assign3">Assignment 3</a>
          <p>
            The third assignment focuses on creating functions to manipulate
            data received by the user. The data is taken in by a form and stored
            in an array that is passed around to different JavaScript statistics
            methods to compute results then display the results back to the
            user. It focuses on practice of repitition control structures.
          </p>
          <p>
            This assignment focuses on JavaScript and helped me practice my
            skills with the language. The form is similar to previous
            assignments for accepting data except there is no validation
            necessary which is nice. It was a bit challenging to come up with
            logic on the first try for the functions, but after tracing the
            values of the variables through the functions, it was easy to fix
            and implement the correct solutions. Testing was also a large
            portion of this assignment.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Implement a form to collect and parse user data</li>
            <li>Practice array manipulation in JavaScript</li>
            <li>Unit test the website for errors</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <hr />
        <section>
          <a class="assignment" href="./assign4">Assignment 4</a>
          <p>
            The fourth assignment consisted of redoing assignment 2 using
            Bootstrap and jQuery. Bootstrap is a modern CSS library that
            incorporates pre-built classes into an HTML document to style
            elements easily. Also, Bootstrap makes web pages responsive to
            different size screens. jQuery allows code to be written in
            JavaScript without the need to use extensive DOM selection and
            modification.
          </p>
          <p>
            This exercise required a lot of researching and learning before I
            could actually implement anything. I already knew HTML, CSS, and JS
            but learning how to create web sites faster is an excellent thing
            that can be achieved by using Bootstrap and jQuery. During the
            process of remaking my assignment 2 I analyzed where I could improve
            my design and then I put this analysis into practice.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Use Bootstrap to write responsive web pages</li>
            <li>Utilize jQuery to write cleaner and faster JavaScript</li>
            <li>
              Plan a better design for a web page by focusing on necessary
              improvements
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <hr />
        <section>
          <a class="assignment" href="./assign5">Assignment 5</a>
          <p>
            The fifth assignment focuses on collecting quiz information from a
            user, validating the answers, and using server side programming with
            PHP to add functionality.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, I was not able to fully complete the assignment. I was able
            to create the quiz from again using Bootstrap. I was not able to
            implement the PHP. This was still good practice for making web
            pages.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Used Bootstrap to write responsive web pages</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <hr />
        <section>
          <a class="assignment" href="./assign6">Assignment 6</a>
          <p>
            The sixth assignment introduces SQL and mySQL to set up and modify
            databases. After creating a simple table, we had to create a basic
            ER diagram to illustrate it. The user will be able to INSERT,
            DELETE, and UPDATE entries in the table through a web app. The web
            app also displays the table and has inputs for new entries. Finally,
            we have to secure our web app from SQL injection.
          </p>
          <p>
            My experience with the assignment was frustrating at first, but I
            eventually became comfortable with mySQL. After creating a database,
            I had a hard time connecting it to my UI using PHP because I hadn't
            practiced PHP in the last assignment like I should have. Overall, it
            was a good learning experience, and I can translate these skills
            onto the group project.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Make simple table with a corresponding ER diagram</li>
            <li>Use mySQL to create, insert, delete, update, select entries</li>
            <li>Utilize HTML and CSS to make a responsive web application</li>
            <li>Connect the web app functionality to the database with PHP</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <hr />
        <section>
          <a class="assignment" href="./assign7">Assignment 7</a>
          <p>
            The seventh assignment focuses on using AJAX to manipulate a webpage
            without refreshing it. It utilizes PHP and JavaScript so that when
            links or buttons are clicked, it calls a function that updates how
            the table is displayed to the screen. We could choose different ways
            to filter the data, but I chose to do it with ascending and
            descending organization of columns.
          </p>
          <p>
            My experience with the assignment was that it was tricky reworking
            the connection to my table to auto-refresh, but once I figure that
            out it was easy to implement the rest. I wanted to keep it simple
            and user friendly but still maintain my styling from the previous
            assignment.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Use PHP to send data to server-side functions</li>
            <li>Write queries in SQL to restructure a database</li>
            <li>Utilize AJAX to organize data without refreshing a webpage</li>
          </ul>
